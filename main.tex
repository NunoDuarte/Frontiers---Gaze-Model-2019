\maketitle


\begin{abstract}

Humans can read the intentions from the non-verbal communication cues emitted by other humans during action-in-interactions \citep{duarte2018action}. Gaze cues have the particularity of expressing the intention of the human executing the action and, when observing an action being executed, express the exploration that humans perform to understand the other’s intention. This interesting behavior can be used to evaluate robotic methods that express robot’s intent in human-robot interactions. 

Our approach consists of using a gaze model biologically inspired in a human-human experiment of a dyadic interaction where humans have to place an object on a table or the give the object to the other participant, in a human-robot interaction scenario \citep{duarte2018actionalignment}. This model utilizes the gaze behavior of humans to understand the action as well as to express intention of the action to execute. With the model, a robotic controller was created to integrate human-inspired gaze behavior to a humanoid robot during action execution, and to give human readability of human’s action from gaze cues. 

To evaluate the controller, human participants will interact with the humanoid robot in a dyadic interaction where the gaze cues will be recorded for analysis of the physiological of a human-robot object hand-over \citep{DEHAIS2011hrhandover}. We will compare this controller with a second controller where the robot does not convey human-inspired gaze behavior.
